Welcome to Stardew Valley modding! Mods can be very rewarding, but they're also pretty anarchic.
This is a collaborative open-source site dedicated to documenting the anarchy.

## Guides

* [Using mods](guides/using-mods)

### For developers
* [Weather](guides/weather), a breakdown of the weather system and fixed days.
