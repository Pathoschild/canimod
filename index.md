Welcome to Stardew Valley modding! Mods can be very rewarding, but they're also pretty anarchic.
This is a collaborative open-source site dedicated to documenting the anarchy.

## Using mods
Most mods require [SMAPI (Stardew Modding API)](https://github.com/cjsu/SMAPI). Make sure you
download the latest version â€” older versions won't work with the latest version of Stardew Valley.

Once you have SMAPI, [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com/stardewvalley) is the best place to find
mods. You can also [discuss mods and modding in the official Stardew Valley forums](http://community.playstarbound.com/forums/mods.215/).

A few tips for downloading mods:

1. Make sure the mod still works with the latest version of the game. Many mods are abandoned after
   their authors stop playing. You can check by reading the latest messages (if on the forums) or
   checking the bugs/discussions/comments sections (if on Nexus Mods). If the author has stopped
   answering questions on the forums, that typically means the mod has been abandoned. If the mod
   wasn't updated after the last Stardew Valley update, it probably doesn't work anymore.
2. Try one mod at a time. That way if the game crashes, you know which one is broken.
